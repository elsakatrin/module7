Hæ! 

This is my project for Module 7 in Vefskólinn. 
I worked with: Next.js, Prismic (Using slicemachine and prismic dashboard), Imgix for Photos, Aoa for animations, SCSS for styling.

My focus for this project was Optimization for images with Imgix/Prismic. 
I looked a lot into quality of images and performance.
I decided that this would be a good opportunity to solve my own website problem and at the same time combine my interests. 

Content is mostly imported from the Prismic Dashboard (Client repository)
Content is put together inside slicemachine where I put what slices should belong inside what custom types. 
In the prismic dashboard (where the client works) the client puts their content in and chooses what slices they want to have.
