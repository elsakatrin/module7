HÃ¦! 
This is a photography page I made for myself. I'm the client so I added in photos through client prismic repository.

It's not fully finished, I tried to comment in the code but I haven't cleaned up the code enought yet.

I've had some trouble with Prismic since starting this project and working with images/Image optimization. 
It's 70% code and 30% design.
I did a lot of research on images on the web, Imgix and prismic.
My plan was to optimize images through prismic and landed on using Imigix for react. Imgix Parameters explained in Album Slice. 

I'd like to get comments on the project as a whole and how it could be better! The expiriance is while navigating it (UX and speed), how it looks and how the images look regarding to quality. It would be nice to get comments on the code and design.
All comments are welcome!

Index/pages is the landingpage
UID is for other pages (not landingpage or nav, only repeatable)
Slices is the content inside pages - it aligns up like I've set up in slicemachine (couldn't show that but you can as if there's any confusion)


Here's my figma file for the project, there's my research for my UI, wireframe and prototype.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
